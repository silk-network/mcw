# MultiChain Wallet

Build a trustless multichain wallet that runs entirely onchain. 

## Overview
This proof-of-concept shows how Oasis Sapphire can be used to build a trustless multichain wallet. With this approach, private keys are stored and protected in a TEE running on Oasis Sapphire's Confidential VM. The security for this approach can be further enhanced with account abstraction. 

This demonstration uses OPL and Sapphire, and shows how to generate and verify cross-chain Intents.

## Technical Components

MultiChain Wallet is made up of the following components:

### Enclave Wallet 
A Sapphire smart contract that functions as a confidential ledger, keeping track of all assets and balances for each user.

### Chain Vault 
A smart contract on an EVM-compatible chain. This is where the native assets are stored. The Chain Vault is responsible for accepting deposits, verifying withdraw Intents and notifying the Enclave wallet of transaction confirmations via the OPL Message Bus.

### OPL - Oasis Privacy Layer
This message bus is used to send transaction confirmations from EVM chains to the Enclave Wallet. The original source for the OPL code, before we refactored, can be found [here](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/sapphire-paratime/tree/f708f3912424c84a6f03f87b9f6f928093da036a/contracts/contracts/opl)


## Local Development

Use [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#overview) and [Hardhat-deploy](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy) for development.

### Setup

Install dependencies
```sh
yarn install
```

Compile contracts
```sh   
yarn compile
```

Run tests
```sh
yarn test
```

Configure and Run the frontend against the testnet deployment.
Edit the file ".env.development" to point to your testnet deployment.

```sh
cd frontend
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Get BNB testnet tokens from the [BNB Faucet](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/testnet-faucet)

## Testnet Deployment

### Prerequisite
The [Oasis Privacy Layer (OPL)](https://oasisprotocol.org/opl). requires an Executor to run on Testnet. Follow the Celer integration [guide](https://im-docs.celer.network/developer/development-guide/message-executor/integration-guide#executor) to setup.

For reference here is the configuration used for our testnet deployment:

```toml
[[service.contracts]]
chain_id = 97 # Bsc testnet
address = "0xb62967a648b5300acf52e93777ff2b944c330f33"
allow_sender_groups = ["wallet"]
[[service.contracts]]
chain_id = 23295 # Sapphire testnet
address = "0x0cAF8DC5f52D27997dda47a7aD3a807E04AB6A3B"
allow_sender_groups = ["wallet"]

[[service.contract_sender_groups]]
name = "wallet" 
allow = [
  { chain_id = 97, address = "0xb62967a648b5300acf52e93777ff2b944c330f33" },
  { chain_id = 23295, address = "0x0cAF8DC5f52D27997dda47a7aD3a807E04AB6A3B" },
]
``` 

### Setup
Prepare your deployment account's private key and store it as an environment variable:

```shell
export PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```

STEP #1 - Deploy the EnclaveWallet contract to the Sapphire Testnet using the following command:

```shell
npx hardhat deploy --network sapphire-testnet
```

Take note of the contract addresses in the response. You will need them in the next step

**Signer Address**: 0x1234 **Enclave Address**: 0x1234

STEP #2 - Deploy the ChainVault contract to the BSC Testnet using the following command (replace the enclave and signer addresses with the ones from the previous step):

```shell
npx hardhat deployVault --network bsc-testnet --signer-address 0x1234 --enclave-address 0x1234 
```

STEP #3 - Register the BSC chain vault address with the EnclaveWallet contract using the following command:

```shell
npx hardhat registerSpokeToHub --network sapphire-testnet --enclave-address 0x1234 --chain-vault-address 0x1234 --vault-chain-id 97
```


## References
The following open source projects were utilized for the development of this proof-of-concept.

### Uniswap Permit2

Inspiration was taken from Uniswap's [EIP712](https://github.com/Uniswap/permit2/blob/cc56ad0f3439c502c246fc5cfcc3db92bb8b7219/src/EIP712.sol) implementation. It was refactored it to support signing messages on one chain and verifying them on another.


### Oasis Privacy Layer
[OPL](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/sapphire-paratime/blob/main/contracts/contracts/opl/Endpoint.sol) is a message bus that allows for secure communication between the Sapphire and remote chains.

It has been refactored to support multiple chains sending messages to the same Sapphire smart contract.

## Security
This code was developed for the purpose of a proof-of-concept. It should be considered experimental and not production ready.
